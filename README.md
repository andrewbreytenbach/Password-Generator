# Password-Generator

## About The Project

This project was to create a professional portfolio to be used as a place to showcase my projects and skillset as a developer. This website will serve as a landing page for all of my developer projects, and it will be sent to potential employers so they can see my skills and projects. 

### Built With

* HTML 
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Getting Started

In order to acess this website, just visit the following webpage: [https://andrewbreytenbach.github.io/Password-Generator/]   (Password-Generator)

To get a local copy up and running, simply view the index.html file, stle.css, or the script.js file and see how you can play around, copy, and edit the file for personal usage. You can also change the password criteria to your personal needs by adjusting the if functions and the variables associated with each prompt. 

## Usage

This is an excellent place to view some of the projects I have worked on. For example, but clicking on the 'Project 1' image, then you will be redirected to my Project 1 page. There the user can see my files, such as html and css files, and in the future even javasceipt files. 

Additionally, if the user wishes to reach me personally by contacting me, then they can click on any of the 'contact me' links at the bottom of the webpage. 

Perhaps the best way to reach me would be by visiting my LinkedIn.
